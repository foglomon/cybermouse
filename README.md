# CYBERMOUSE

A futuristic looking mouse shell inspired by CyberPunk and Nano Fluid (Nano bots from Iron Man). This mouse shell is built for the Bambu Labs Wireless Mouse Kit and features a sleek and clean looking shell that looks good with any color theme chosen. Just import the step files into a program of your choice and hit print!

I've been wanting to build a custom case because for me, it's about making something that's not just functional but also a reflection of my own style. I want to create a mouse that feels uniquely mine, something I designed and built myself that makes my desk setup feel more personal.
